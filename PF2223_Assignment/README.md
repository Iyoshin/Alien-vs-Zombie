# Alien vs. Zombie

Please introduce the game here.

You may add one signature screenshot of your program here or above the title. Check out [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/markdown-markdown-images) to learn how to do it.

Please provide the YouTube link to your [Video Demo]([https://youtube.com](https://youtu.be/c01ivuqSbBc)).

## Compilation Instructions

Provide instructions on how to compile your program, especially when it is non-trivial.

g++ pf\*.cpp main.cpp -o main

to run type after compile ./main.exe

## User Manual

1. Compile the file using g++ pf\*.cpp main.cpp -o main with the correct file path. Run the program by typing ./main.exe.
2. You may change the number of rows, columns and zombie (but for zombie nothing will happen at this moment) before the game starts.
3. The list of command (you may also type 'help' in command to display the list of command):
    - up - alien move up
    - down - alien move down
    - left - alien move left
    - right - alien move right
    - arrow - enter row, column and direction (direction e.g. right, left etc.) (you may use arrow command as many time as you want before alien making a move)
    - help - display the list of commands
    - save/load/quit is not implemented yet, if you type in either of this it will return back to the command interface.
4. After type in movement (e.g. up) command, the alien will move by itself but you will need to press any key to continue the program.     
5. The alien will stop after hitting border or rock.
6. Currently, this program will stop after alien making one move.
